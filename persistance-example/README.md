# Example files for making the server persistent

With these two bash scripts, you can start the hue server (or several servers), 
when a physical problem occurs on the machine hosting the server (reboot or start-up after maintenance)

Were tested in a linux environment, specifically with ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS,
in the example we wait 60 seconds for the servers to reboot and direct the console output to the respective log files

<sub>P.S: a more accurate explanation can be found in the main readme</sub>
